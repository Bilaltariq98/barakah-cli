Perform a Barakah check for the developer. This is a mindfulness and productivity reset.

Do the following:

1. **Check in on the developer's state.** Ask them briefly how they're feeling — energy level, focus, stress. Keep it to one question, not an interrogation.

2. **Review the session so far.** Summarize what has been accomplished in this session in 2-3 sentences. Reference their Niyyah (intention) if one was set at the start.

3. **Suggest a micro-reset.** Based on the conversation so far:
   - If they've been debugging heavily → suggest a 2-minute break and fresh eyes
   - If they've been productive → acknowledge it with Shukr and suggest committing progress
   - If they seem scattered → help them re-prioritize with a quick task list

4. **End with a brief reminder.** Pick ONE of these (rotate, don't repeat the same one):
   - "SubhanAllahi wa bihamdihi, SubhanAllahil Azeem"
   - "La hawla wa la quwwata illa billah — there is no power except with Allah"
   - "HasbunAllahu wa ni'mal wakeel — Allah is sufficient for us"

Keep the entire response under 150 words. This is a pause, not a lecture.

If the user provides additional arguments with the command (e.g., `/barakah-cli:barakah ramadan`), adapt:
- `ramadan` → Include a fasting-aware energy check
- `reset` → Just give the dhikr reminder, nothing else
- `status` → Show the interaction count and session duration
