Help the developer reset or set their Niyyah (intention) for the current session.

If the developer provides arguments (e.g., `/barakah-cli:niyyah finish the payment integration`), acknowledge their intention warmly and briefly. For example: "Bismillah. Your intention is set: finish the payment integration. Let's make it happen."

If no arguments are provided, ask them: "What would you like your intention to be for the rest of this session?" Then acknowledge whatever they share.

Keep it brief — 1-2 sentences max. This is a moment of focus, not a conversation.
